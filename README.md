## 🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure of the game.
CSS: Adds styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Handles the game logic and interactivity.

📱 Responsive Design
The game is designed to work seamlessly across devices:
On desktops, the grid layout is optimized for visibility.
On smaller devices, the grid and fonts adjust dynamically.

📝 How to Play
The first player uses "O" and the second uses "X".
Players take turns clicking on the grid boxes.
The game checks for a winner:
Three matching symbols (O or X) in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
If all boxes are filled without a winner, the game declares a tie.
Use "Reset Game" or "New Game" to play again.

🌟 Future Improvements
Add a single-player mode with AI.
Implement score tracking across multiple rounds.
Add animations for winning combinations.
